Stardust
========

An interactive installation that uses content transfer (stardust) through touch projected on the body. 

Inspired by Lawrence Krauss' quote "you are all stardust", I used stardust as a metaphor for interconnectedness.
In this interactive installation, through the playful situation of tag, participants can pass the stardust 
to each other, exploring the system and the physical boundaries between them.
